# Log of #100DaysOfCode - in 2019

## Day 1: July 17, Wednesday

**Today's Progress:** Spent time creating an chrome extension to remove GIFs on anime website

**Thoughts:** Feel good in the end, but I should find somehow to remove GIFs before page rendering.

## Day 2: July 18, Thursday

**Today's Progress:** Develop an automated certification for people who joined the design your dream camp 2019 

**Thoughts:** Learning how to download the canvas as an image with custom fillText inserting. However, DPI's background in canvas is not quite worked well when rendering on webpage. It was blurred. I decided to remove canvas from DOM and give it created when download button trigged.
